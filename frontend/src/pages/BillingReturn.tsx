 * appends the order id as `?token=<order_id>`, not `order_id` — see the
 * PayPal Orders v2 docs; `PayerID` is also appended but unused here.
 *
 * Capture is documented as idempotent (docs/openapi.yaml's
 * POST /billing/capture: "capturing an already-captured order returns
 * credited=false with the unchanged balance instead of calling PayPal
 * again"), so firing it once on mount is safe.
 *
 * Whatever goes wrong here — a network error, PayPal still showing PENDING,
 * a stale token — the user must NEVER be told the money is lost: an
 * already-approved order either completes via this call or via the
 * webhook (see BillingController's webhook handler), so the fallback copy
 * always points at that safety net instead.
