# Benchmarks

The pitch for a C++ service is latency and footprint. Those numbers are
**hardware- and workload-specific**, so this template ships the *harness* to
measure them on your machine rather than a marketing number you can't reproduce.
The "10x vs a managed runtime" framing in the README is the general reason to
reach for C++ here; the absolute numbers below are what you should verify for
your own deployment.

## What to measure

| Metric | How |
|---|---|
| Latency p50 / p99 / p99.9 | `make bench` (wrk) against `/healthz` (no DB) and `/api/v1/jobs` (DB path) |
| Throughput (req/s) | same wrk run |
| Runtime image size | `docker build --target runtime` then `docker images` (the slim runtime stage, **not** the builder/test image) |
| Idle / under-load RSS | `docker stats` locally, or `kubectl top pod` on a cluster |
| Cold start to `/ready` | time from container start to a 200 on `/ready` |

Measure `/healthz` and a DB-backed route separately: the first isolates the HTTP
+ middleware path, the second includes Postgres/Redis round-trips, so a slow
number there points at the database, not the framework.

## Harness

`scripts/bench.sh` drives [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) against the running
app under a set of config presets in `config/bench/`:

| Preset | What it varies |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | 4 server threads, DB pool 10 — the default shape |
| `threads8` | 8 server threads — scaling with cores |
| `pool20` / `pool50` | DB connection pool 20 / 50 — DB-bound headroom |
| `max` | the aggressive preset — find the ceiling |

```bash
make up                          # bring up app + Postgres + Redis
make bench                       # one preset (P=baseline) against E=/api/v1/jobs
make bench-all E=/healthz        # every preset against one endpoint
# or drive the script directly with wrk args:
./scripts/bench.sh baseline /healthz
./scripts/bench.sh all /api/v1/jobs -c100 -d10s
```

Environment overrides: `WRK_THREADS`, `WRK_CONNS`, `WRK_DURATION`, `APP_URL`.

## Continuous benchmarks

A nightly workflow (`.github/workflows/bench-nightly.yml`) runs the `baseline`
preset on master — wrk against `/healthz` and `/api/v1/jobs` — plus three
low-noise footprint metrics (runtime image size, cold start to `/ready`, idle
RSS), and appends every point to a public trend:

**<https://moveeeax.github.io/mi-fitness-api/dev/bench/>**

Read it as a **trend**, not as absolute numbers: GitHub shared runners are
noisy (±10–20% between nights is normal). A regression above 30% against the
previous point posts an alert commit comment automatically; no PR is ever
blocked by benchmarks. For absolute numbers on your hardware, run
`make bench` as described above.

## Methodology notes

- **Warm up** before recording — discard the first run (JIT-free here, but the
  DB pool, caches, and page cache still warm).
- **Pin the variable**: change one preset dimension at a time.
- Run the load generator off the box under test when you care about the tail —
  co-locating wrk steals CPU from the server and inflates p99.
- Record the hardware (CPU model, cores, RAM) and the commit — numbers without
  that context aren't comparable.
