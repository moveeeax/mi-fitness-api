-- Migration 008: billing_settings — single-row, admin-editable runtime
-- config for the billing module (credits-per-unit rate + custom top-up
-- bounds).
--
-- Applied in numeric order on boot. The MigrationRunner wraps this file in ONE
-- transaction under an advisory lock — do NOT add BEGIN/COMMIT. Idempotent DDL.
--
-- Why a table instead of reusing an existing mechanism: this codebase has no
-- runtime-config store — every admin-editable value to date lives in
-- config/config.json + env var overrides (Config::get<T>), which requires a
-- redeploy to change. The admin billing-settings endpoint needs a rate/bounds
-- change to take effect immediately for the next top-up, so it needs a real
-- row to UPDATE.
--
-- Single-row guard: `id` is a CHECK(id = 1) SMALLINT PK — a second INSERT
-- always collides on the primary key, so UPDATE is structurally the only way
-- to change these values (same shape as any other single-row settings table;
-- this codebase's closest precedent, migration 004's admin permission
-- sentinel, is a one-time data migration rather than a live-edited row, so
-- this pattern is new here but standard practice elsewhere).
--
-- The seeded defaults (100 / 100 / 100000) are copied verbatim from
-- config/config.json's billing.credits_per_unit / min_amount_cents /
-- max_amount_cents — so a fresh database's admin-settings round-trip starts
-- from the exact same numbers the config-only read path would have used
-- before this migration existed.
