/**
 * @file BillingMetricsRepository.hpp
 * @brief Aggregate queries backing the admin billing-metrics endpoint. One
 *        parameterized query per aggregate block, run inside a single read
 *        transaction so the whole response is a consistent snapshot.
 *
 * Window semantics (see the admin controller's period -> MetricsWindow
 * mapping):
 *   - revenue/count/avg, conversion, and refunds are all windowed as
 *     `created_at >= now() - interval '<N>'` — a ROLLING window, not
 *     calendar-aligned.
 *   - the `series` block is calendar/bucket-aligned instead (it has to be,
 *     to produce fixed-width buckets with no gaps): its span is
 *     `[date_trunc(bucket, now()) - (bucket_count-1)*step, date_trunc(bucket, now())]`,
 *     which is very close to but not bit-identical to the rolling window
 *     above (it can extend up to one bucket-width earlier). Both are correct
 *     readings of "the last day/week/month"; they just don't sum to bit-for-
 *     bit the same total, same as any dashboard mixing a rolling KPI with a
 *     calendar-bucketed chart.
 *   - `outstanding_credits` / `outstanding_value_cents` are NOT windowed at
 *     all — `wallet_balances` is a point-in-time liability snapshot, not an
 *     event stream, so "outstanding as of now" is the only meaningful
 *     reading.
 *
 * "Ever captured money" vs "captured only": revenue/count/avg,
 * conversion_captured, the series bucketing, and top_packages/top_users all
 * filter on `status IN ('captured', 'refunded')`, NOT `status = 'captured'`
 * alone. `Wallet::refund_capture` flips a payment's status from `captured`
 * to `refunded` once the CUMULATIVE refunded total reaches the full
 * `amount_cents` (see migrations/007_billing.sql's status comment and
 * Wallet.hpp's refund_capture doc, step 5) — a PARTIAL refund leaves
 * `status = 'captured'` untouched. Filtering on `status = 'captured'` alone
 * would therefore drop a fully-refunded (or fully charged-back — a
 * capture-reversed webhook event drives the identical debit path) payment
 * out of gross revenue/conversion/top-lists entirely, while `refunds_cents`
 * still counts its refund as a deduction — double-penalizing it (removed
 * from gross AND shown as a refund) and inconsistent with a partial refund,
 * which stays fully in gross. `status IN ('captured', 'refunded')` means
 * "this payment's money was successfully captured at checkout, whatever
 * happened afterward" — the correct base for gross revenue and for
 * `conversion` (which an admin reads as "did checkout succeed", not "is it
 * still unrefunded right now"). `refunds_cents`/`refunds_count` remain the
 * single, separate deduction line — gross revenue minus refunds is the
 * intended way to read net, exactly as it would be for a partial refund.
 *
 * Money math: `outstanding_value_cents = outstanding_credits * 100 /
 * credits_per_unit` (integer division) — the exact inverse of how the
 * top-up flow computes `credits_expected = amount_cents * credits_per_unit
 * / 100` for a custom top-up (migration 008's column comment:
 * credits_per_unit is "credits granted per 100 cents"). The caller passes
 * the CURRENT rate (Repositories::BillingSettingsRepository::get()
 * .credits_per_unit) in — this repository does not read billing_settings
 * itself, so there is exactly one place (the admin controller) that decides
 * which rate is "current".
